                              A mechanical (pressure) wave is what sound is.
                              Actually, the sound wave's energy causes the
                              medium it travels through to oscillate (air, in
                              this case). An EM wave's energy is contained in
                              its electric and magnetic fields, so it does not
                              require a medium to travel through.

                              Yes, even in a perfect vacuum, EM waves can still
                              propagate. No medium is necessary for the energy
                              to travel because it is carried by the oscillating
                              electric and magnetic fields. No, a perfect vacuum
                              cannot allow sound waves to pass through. A
                              perfect vacuum lacks the medium necessary to
                              transport the energy of mechanical waves like
                              sound.

                              When you turn on a light switch, electrons in the
                              filament wire need to move in order to illuminate
                              the bulb, and they require energy in order to
                              start moving. Although it does take some time for
                              the energy to move through the wires from the
                              switch to the bulb, this time is incredibly brief
                              because the energy moves through the wires with
                              the EM fields almost as quickly as light.
                              <br />
                              Little time passes because it takes some time for
                              the EM (light) waves to travel from the bulb to
                              your eye, even though they do so at the speed of
                              light. Your eyes can typically detect some delay
                              because it takes the filament a little while to
                              heat up to a temperature where it emits visible
                              light. Additionally, the length of time it takes
                              for you to see the light turn on may vary
                              depending on the circuit's inductance (inductance
                              acts like an electrical inertia). So, no, the
                              light does not turn on instantly when the switch
                              is flipped, but there is only a very slight delay.

                              The signals will be "scrambled" if two TV or radio
                              stations broadcast on the same carrier frequency
                              and their signals are similar in strength in the
                              same area. The receiver distinguishes between
                              various stations using the carrier frequency. The
                              receiver's circuitry then goes to work
                              demodulating the data being transmitted on that
                              carrier frequency after it has locked on to a
                              specific carrier frequency. In the event that two
                              stations used the same carrier frequency, the
                              receiver would attempt to decode both signals
                              simultaneously, resulting in a jumbled signal
                              rather than a clear one.

                If a radio transmitter has a vertical antenna, should a
                receiverâ€™s antenna (rod type) be vertical or horizontal to
                obtain best reception?

                              For the best reception, the receiver antenna
                              should also be vertical. A vertical antenna would
                              "pick up" the oscillating carrier electric field
                              signal better because the electrons in the metal
                              antenna would be forced to oscillate up and down
                              along the entire length of the vertical antenna,
                              resulting in a stronger signal. This has a similar
                              effect to polarized light, which was covered in
                              chapter 24.

                The carrier frequencies of FM broadcasts are much higher than
                for AM broadcasts. On the basis of what you learned about
                diffraction in Chapter 11, explain why AM signals can be
                detected more readily than FM signals behind low hills or
                buildings.

                              Only when the wavelength of the wave is greater
                              than the size of the object do diffraction effects
                              (the bending of waves around the edge of an
                              object) become visible. While FM waves have
                              wavelengths of about 3 m, AM waves have
                              wavelengths that are about 300 m long. Since hills
                              and buildings are much larger than FM waves, FM
                              waves will not diffract around them. As a result,
                              the FM signal won't be picked up behind hills or
                              structures. However, because these objects are
                              smaller than AM waves, they will easily cause AM
                              waves to diffract around them. You can pick up the
                              AM signal from behind the objects.
