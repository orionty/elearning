                              The magnetic field of the Earth occasionally has a
                              component that is perpendicular to the surface; it
                              is not always parallel to the surface. One end of
                              the compass will dip downward as it tends to align
                              with the magnetic field's local direction. The
                              term "angle of dip" refers to the angle that the
                              Earth's magnetic field makes with the horizontal.

                              determine the direction. Observe that the magnetic
                              field lines would point into the paper above the

                              Any metallic object will not be drawn to a magnet.
                              A magnet, for instance, will draw paper clips and
                              nails but not coins or scraps of aluminum foil.
                              This is so because ferromagnetic materials (such
                              as iron, cobalt, nickel, gadolinium, and some of
                              their oxides and alloys) are the only ones that
                              magnets will draw to themselves. The only widely
                              used materials are iron and its alloys. When a
                              powerful magnet is brought close to these
                              ferromagnetic materials, the magnetic domains
                              within them can be made to temporarily align. The
                              strong magnet's south pole and the domain's north
                              pole are pointed in opposite directions by the
                              alignment, which produces the attraction.

                              A typical household circuit uses 60 Hz AC current.
                              The compass needle's reaction to 60 Hz (changing
                              direction back and forth at 60 full cycles per
                              second) won't likely be felt because of its mass.
                              Depending on the relative orientation of the wire
                              and the compass, the strength of the current, and
                              the distance between the wire and the compass, a
                              DC current in a single wire may have an impact on
                              the compass. The compass needle would not be
                              significantly affected by a DC current flowing in
                              opposite directions along two very close wires
                              because the magnetic fields created by the two
                              currents have a tendency to cancel one another
                              out.

                If a negatively charged particle enters a region of uniform
                magnetic field which is perpendicular to the particleâ€™s
                velocity, will the kinetic energy of the particle increase,
                decrease, or stay the same? Explain your answer. (Neglect
                gravity and assume there is no electric field.)

                A positively charged particle in a nonuniform magnetic field
                follows the trajectory shown in Fig. 20â€“49. Indicate the
                direction of the magnetic field at points near the path,
                assuming the path is always in the plane of the page, and
                indicate the relative magnitudes of the field in each region.
                Explain your answers.

                              According to the right-hand rule, if the positive
                              particle is deflected upward, the magnetic field
                              must be inside the paper, and if it is deflected
                              downward, the magnetic field must be outside the
                              paper, as the positive particle moves to the
                              right. Additionally, the charged particle will
                              turn more tightly the stronger the magnetic field
                              is. At the initial bend, the magnetic field must
                              be relatively weak and directed into the paper. At
                              the second bend, the magnetic field must be
                              moderate in size and directed away from the paper.
                              At the third bend, the magnetic field must be
                              relatively strong and directed into the paper.
